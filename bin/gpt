# Asks AI a question. The response is cached. Includes a "related word" in mandarin too.

HEADER='Do not directly answer the question. You must instead give a concise single line response in this format: {中文} {pīnyīn}: {definition}". {中文} is a Simplified Chinese word loosely related to the question, {pīnyīn} is the pinyin pronunciation for that word, {definition} is a very concise English definition of that word.

Example:
Q: Greetings
A: 你好 nǐhǎo: hello'

PROMPT='Be concise & pragmatic. Prefer to just give answers with no explanation. Likely context: linux, code'
