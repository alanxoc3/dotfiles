## My Workflow
Here are programs I use often as part of my daily workflow.

### Terminal Apps

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). Fuzzy find for anything.
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/). Github made an official CLI. I use it for managing issues and PRs now.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/). The magical version control software.
- [keynav](https://github.com/jordansissel/keynav). Navigate your keyboard with Vim key bindings.

- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/). A terminal based & gpg encrypted password manager.
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger). Navigate files with Vim bindings. (I'm looking for a more minimalistic replacement though.)
- [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Search file content super fast. Faster and cooler than grep.
