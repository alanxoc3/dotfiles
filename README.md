## My Workflow
Here are programs I use often as part of my daily workflow.

### Terminal Apps
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/). The new vim.
- [keynav](https://github.com/jordansissel/keynav). Navigate your keyboard with vim keybindings.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/). The magical version control software.
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/). Github made an official CLI. I use it for managing issues and PRs now.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux). Terminal multiplexer.
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/). I was actually still using bash until August-ish 2020.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). Fuzzy find for anything.
- [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Search file content super fast. Faster and cooler than grep.
- [concards](https://github.com/alanxoc3/concards). I've been reviewing/creating flashcards everyday with this.
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger). Navigate files with vim bindings. (I'm looking for a more minimalistic replacement though.)

### Gui Apps
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/). Tiling based window manager. (I use this now, but I plan on switching to [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) in a few weeks.)
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks). Put some nice things in your i3status bar.
- [i3lock](https://github.com/i3/i3lock). Simple lockscreen for i3.
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi). Application search menu. Integrates well with i3.
- [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/). Chromium based web browser with vim bindings.
- [termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite). The terminal emulator I use.

### Neovim Plugins
- [SirVer/ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). Snippets for vim.
- [junegunn/fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim). Fzf integration with vim.
- [justinmk/vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak). Jump to lines in file faster.
- [jamessan/vim-gnupg](https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg). Edit gpg encrypted files with vim.

### Misc Technologies
- [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/). Open source dropbox, installed on my personal server and computer.
- [arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). My main operating system.
